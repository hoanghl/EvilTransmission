# EvilTransmission

## 1. Introduction

This is a side project in my leisure weekend time. It aims at developing full-stack application that is able to exchange data (mostly _evil_ images and videos).

## 2. Client

**Flutter** is used to develop smartphone application.
Please visit [Client](Client/README.md) for more information.

## 3. Server

**Python** is used to develop server side. I don't use any existing framework but building it from scratch with builtin Python libraries.

Please visit [a relative link](Server/README.md) for more information.

## 4. Protocol

I develop a dedicated TCP protocol to exchange data between client and server. My proposed one, namely **Protocol 3Vil** is inspired from _MQTT_.

## 5. Features

- [x] Basic components for both client and server
- [x] Basic components for protocol
- [ ] Upgrade protocol to send both images and videos
- [ ] Add encryption
- [ ] Beautify client app
